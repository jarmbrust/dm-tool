    <h3>Hello!</h3>
    <p>
      I am James, and this is my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a coder, gamer, writer, history buff, science buff, and general polymath living with my wonderful wife and our menagerie of dogs and cats in beautiful Colorado.
    </p>

    <p>
      I just created this website here on April 8th, so it is pretty bare right now, but I will fill it out as I go here.  Most of last weekend was taken up working on the player stat tool from my D&D game.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are curious, site is built utilizing the <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vuejs</a> javascript framework (which has similarities to both React and Angular 2), and my code for it can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jarmbrust/dm-tool">GitHub</a>. Note it was called dm-tool as the original intention of the site was to build a tool for gamemastering.  It is still my intent to build out that tool, but I will instead make that part of the overall website.
