    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>
      I am James, and this is my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a coder, gamer, writer, history buff, science buff, and self-described polymath living with my wonderful wife and our menagerie of dogs and cats in beautiful Colorado.

      I created this a few days ago, so still a work in progress.  I hope to have more up in the next few days but for now you can checkout the "Player Stat Tool" I made for an upcoming D&D game I'll be running.

    <p>
      If you are curious, site is built utilizing the <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vuejs</a> javascript framework (which has similarities to both React and Angular 2), and my code for it can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jarmbrust/dm-tool">GitHub</a>.
