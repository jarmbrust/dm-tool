    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>
      I am James, and this is my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a coder, gamer, writer, history buff, science buff, and self-described polymath living with my wonderful wife and our menagerie of dogs and cats in sunny Colorado.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      This site is still a work in progress, so please excuse the mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you are curious, site is built utilizing the <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vuejs</a> javascript framework (which has similarities to both React and Angular 2), and my code for it can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jarmbrust/dm-tool">GitHub</a>.
